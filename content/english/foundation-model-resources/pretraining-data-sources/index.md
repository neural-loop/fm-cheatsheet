Pretraining data consists of thousands, or even millions, of individual documents, often web scraped. As a result, their contents are often superficially documented or understood.

This decision should reflect choices in the language coverage, the mix of sources, and preprocessing decisions. We highlight a few of the most popular pretraining corpora which have accumulated deeper documentation or analyses.
